To work in the project, you can copy a link to the Git repository through a
SSH or a HTTPS protocol.  SSH is easier to use after it's been setup.[1]  When
you're in the project, click on the HTTPS or SSH button at the right side of
your screen.  Then copy the link (you'll have to paste it on your shell in the
next step).
